\title{Class "MethyLumiM": for Illumina Methylation microarray data}
\description{
MethyLumiM is a class inherited from \code{\link[Biobase]{ExpressionSet-class}}. It is designed for Illumina Methylation microarray data. The exprs dataMatrix included in the assayData slot of MethyLumiM object includes a matrix of M-values, which is the log2 ratio of methylated and unmethylated probe intensities. The MethyLumiM class include a boxplot function uniquely designed for two-mode histogram data. It also include a coerce function to map from \code{\link[methylumi]{MethyLumi-class}}, \code{\link[methylumi]{MethyLumiSet-class}} or other \code{\link[Biobase]{eSet-class}} inherited object to MethyLumiM class object. 
}
\section{Objects from the Class}{
Objects can be created by calls of the form \code{new("MethyLumiM", exprs, methylated, unmethylated, detection, ..., assayData)}.
The "exprs" is a matrix of M-values, which is the log2 ratio of methylated and unmethylated probe intensities; "methylated" and "unmethylated" are intensity matrix measured by methylated and unmethylalted probes of Illumina Infinium methylation microarray; "detection" is the detection p-value outputted by Illumina GenomeStudio software. "exprs", "methylated" and "unmethylated" information are required for MethyLumiM class. When creating a new MethyLumiM object, the information of "exprs", "methylated", "unmethylated" and "detection" can also be provided directly through "assayData".
